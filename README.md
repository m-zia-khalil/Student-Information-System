# Student-Information-System
A simple C++ OOP project that demonstrates the concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, and separating interface and implementation through a Student Information System. The program stores and displays student details such as name, age, roll no, and GPA, and calculates the grade based on the GPA. It also uses constructor and destructor.
